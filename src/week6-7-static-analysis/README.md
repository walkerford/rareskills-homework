# Week 6-7 Static Analysis

Each echidna exercise has its own folder with config and a Makefile to run the
command. Change into the directory for each exercise before running one of the
following commands:

`make echidna-fail` tests the contract and shows a failing test.
`make echidna-pass` tests the fixed contract and shows passing tests.
