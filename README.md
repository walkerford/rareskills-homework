## Rareskills-homework

This is my work for the [Rareskills](https://www.rareskills.io/) [Advanced Solidity program](https://www.rareskills.io/solidity-bootcamp).

I am using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) as the execution and unit-testing framework for my solidity contracts.

Summaries of each week's assignments, including the written responses, are located in the `homework/` folder.

Solidity contracts are found in the `src/` folder within their respective assigned week sub-folder.

Run the test suite with:

```
forge test
```
